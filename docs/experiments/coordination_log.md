# Coordination Log

## 2026-06-12

### Committed

- `85a21c1` adds the experiment plan from `EXPERIMENTS.md` and keeps `.env`
  out of Git.
- `5978a62` adds the Stage 1 scaffold: `uv` project setup, Tier-1 matchers,
  corpus streaming/sampling helpers, sampled census CLI, W&B helper, Stage 1
  configs, and component notes.

### Active Components

- Preference-pair census expansion: measure `chosen` and `rejected` responses
  separately while retaining plain-text corpus behavior.
- Tests: cover corpus IO, matcher extraction, and disabled-W&B smoke paths.
- Dataset schema notes: verify live availability and lightweight schemas for
  first-stage OLMo data sources without downloading large corpora.

### Coordination Decisions

- Stage 1 stays CPU-first. Regex census and corpus sampling should not consume
  A100 time.
- A100 work starts only after the teacher-forced harness has a validated small
  shard and eager-vs-`torch.compile` benchmark plan.
- All non-smoke experiment runs must log to W&B through `WANDB_API_KEY` loaded
  from `.env`. Local smoke checks should use `--wandb-mode disabled`.
- Corpus measurements can use deterministic samples. Record sample caps, seeds,
  and scan limits in W&B config and output tables.

### Next Go/No-Go Questions

- Do the Dolci SFT/DPO/RL datasets expose stable response and pair fields?
- Can DPO chosen/rejected roles be verified well enough to interpret Result A?
- Do core Tier-1 matchers pass precision checks after 200-hit validation?
- Does sampled corpus throughput leave enough headroom before adding Tier-2 or
  model-facing jobs?
